## Case 1: training on whole population

Match AA and WA within each site. Integrate all sites into 10 folds based on the number of matched AA-WA pairs. Select 3/10 folds as test set, the remaining 7/10 folds as training set (in total 120 variations). Generate suitable output `.mat` files to facilitate later-on kernel ridge regression requirement.

Top-level script: `ABCD_match_and_split.m`. It calls the other scripts in order: `ABCD_match_WAtoAA_within_site.m`, `ABCD_stats_MatchDiff_AAvsWA.m`, `ABCD_split_folds.m`, `ABCD_split_unselected.m`. Exemplar usage of `ABCD_match_and_split.m` (matlab):

```matlab
ABCD_match_and_split('/path/to/lists/phenotypes_pass_rs.txt', ...
    '/path/to/lists/subjects_pass_rs_pass_pheno.txt', ...
    'race', 'site', 'family_id', '/path/to/lists/confounds_list.txt', ...
    '/path/to/lists/behavior_list.txt', 100, 2.45, '/output/dir/', ...
    '_pass_rs_pass_pheno')
```

`'/path/to/lists/phenotypes_pass_rs.txt'` is the csv file generated by `../preparation/ABCD_read_all_measures.m`. `'/path/to/lists/subjects_pass_rs_pass_pheno.txt'` is the list of subjects who passed all quality controls and had all required phenotypes, generated by `../preparation/ABCD_read_all_measures.m`. `'/path/to/lists/confounds_list.txt'` is a list specified by the user containing the confounding variables to be matched. `'/path/to/lists/behavior_list.txt'` is the list of behavioral names generated by `../preparation/ABCD_read_all_measures.m`. `100` and `2.45` are the parameters used for matching. They were picked to reach lower enough matching cost and keep as many as matched pairs. `'_pass_rs_pass_pheno'` is a string attached to the output files, specified by the user.

## Case 2: training solely on AA



## Post-hoc analyses (sub-analyses in the manuscript)

### Compare behavioral variances between matched AA and WA

Check if the difference in behavioral scores were significantly different between matched AA and WA using Levene's test.

Example (matlab):
```matlab
ABCD_pheno_var_AAvsWA_matched(...
    '/path/to/matched_AA_WA/mat/files/sel_AAWA_pass_rs_pass_pheno.mat', ...
    '/path/to/lists/subjects_pass_rs_pass_pheno.txt', ...
    '/path/to/lists/phenotypes_pass_rs.txt', '/output/filename.mat')
```

`'/path/to/matched_AA_WA/mat/files/sel_AAWA_pass_rs_pass_pheno.mat'` is the output file of `ABCD_match_and_split.m`. It contains the selected matched pairs of AA and WA IDs and the corresponded confounding and behavioral scores. `'/path/to/lists/subjects_pass_rs_pass_pheno.txt'` is the list of subjects who passed all quality controls and had all required phenotypes, generated by `../preparation/ABCD_read_all_measures.m`. `'/path/to/lists/phenotypes_pass_rs.txt'` is the csv file generated by `../preparation/ABCD_read_all_measures.m`.
